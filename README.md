# Breaking Captcha
- The code has been organised into different folders based on the approach used.
- The approaches are written down in the report submitted
- The `Models` folder contains the trained models for the approaches. They also have been annotated as per the report
- Normally `Task 0.py` and `Task 1.py` refers to the easy and hard set generation code.
- Some of the model have their own test code, which can be run to test the model.
- The report is can be seen  [here](Precog Report.pdf)
# Requirements
- The code has been tested on Python 3.11
- The code is optimised for Mac Laptops using `mps` supported GPUs and hence may not work efficiently with Linux or Windows
- The code requires the following libraries to be installed bare minimum:
  - `torch`
  - `torchvision`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `PIL`
  - `tqdm`
  - `opencv-python`
  - `pandas`
